    <h1>Guacamole</h1>
    <p>This page is about directions for how to make guacamole. <br>This is my favorite food for many reasons- it is <b>delicious</b>, <b>easy to make</b>, and highly <b>customizable</b>, <br>and as a vegetarian dish it is relatively healthy and completely <b>cholesterol free</b>. <img src="guac.jpg"                                                                                                                                                                                    ></a>.</p>
